# Cloak vs. Legacy Mixers: The Evolution of Solana Privacy

While both Cloak and legacy protocols like **Privacy Cash** (Tornado-style mixers) aim to provide on-chain privacy, they operate on fundamentally different technical architectures and philosophical foundations. This document outlines why Cloak's **Stealth Infrastructure** is the superior solution for the Solana ecosystem.

## 1. Architectural Difference: Mixing vs. Stealth

| Feature | Privacy Cash (Mixer) | Cloak (Stealth Infrastructure) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | **Anonymity Set Pool**: Users deposit funds into a shared pool and withdraw to a new address using ZK-proofs. | **Stealth Vaults**: Funds are sent to a unique, one-time-use address (PDA) derived from the recipient's keys. |
| **Identity Link** | Breaks the link between Deposit and Withdrawal by "hiding in a crowd." | Breaks the link between Sender and Recipient by "hiding the destination." |
| **Wait Time** | Requires waiting for a large "anonymity set" to ensure privacy. | **Immediate**. Privacy is achieved through cryptographic derivation, not pool size. |
| **Amounts** | Fixed denominations (e.g., 1 SOL, 10 SOL, 100 SOL) to maintain set consistency. | **Flexible**. Any amount of SOL or SPL tokens can be sent to a stealth vault. |

### 2. "Blackbox" vs. "Graybox": 5 Key Differences

The shift from Blackbox (Legacy) to Graybox (Cloak) represents a move towards professional-grade financial security.

| # | Feature | **Blackbox (Legacy Mixers)** | **Graybox (Cloak Infrastructure)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Primary Goal** | **Total Anonymity**: Hiding the entire trail of money from all parties. | **Data Protection**: Shielding the user's main wallet and wealth from public eyes. |
| **2** | **Auditability** | **None**: No way to prove the origin of funds without revealing the master secret. | **Selective**: Use of **Viewing Keys** allows auditing without giving up control of funds. |
| **3** | **Network Risk** | **High**: Pools often attract "tainted" funds, leading to global sanctions. | **Low**: P2P stealth transfers prevent the "dirty pool" effect; no shared liquidity. |
| **4** | **Speed & Cost** | **Slow/Expensive**: Heavy ZK-proofs and waiting for anonymity sets. | **Instant/Cheap**: Low-latency PDA derivation and direct Solana-native transfers. |
| **5** | **User Intent** | **Hiding Identity**: Ideal for those seeking absolute untraceability. | **Financial Privacy**: Ideal for professionals, whales, and DAOs needing operational security. |

## 3. Solana-Native UX and 2026 Standards

Legacy mixers are often clunky and require multiple transactions. Cloak is built for the **Solana 2026** paradigm:
- **Blinks & Actions**: Execute a stealth transfer directly via a social link (Blink) without leaving your feed.
- **PDA-First Design**: Leveraging Solana's **Program Derived Addresses** to create temporary "smart vaults" that exist only for the duration of the transfer.
- **Web3.js v2 Integration**: Modular and lightning-fast cryptographic operations handled within the browser extension.

## 4. The Relayer Network: Air-Gapped Claims

In legacy mixers, users often faced a "chicken and egg" problem: needing SOL to pay gas for a withdrawal.

In **Cloak**, the **Relayer Network** is a professionalized service layer:
- **Rent Rebate**: Relayers handle the claim and receive the vault's rent exemption as part of their fee.
- **Complete Isolation**: The recipient's main wallet never interacts with the stealth vault to fund the transaction, providing an **air-gapped** claim process that preserves privacy.

## Summary

**Privacy Cash** is a **Mixer** designed for anonymity through pooling.
**Cloak** is a **Privacy Pipeline** designed for secure, decoupled transfers using stealth addresses.

Cloak represents the next generation of privacy: it is **Solana-optimized**, faster, flexible, and architecturally aligned with the needs of a professional financial ecosystem.
