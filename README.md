# 🛡️ Cloak: Professional Privacy Infrastructure on Solana

> **"A professional infrastructure reconciling the transparent nature of blockchain with the necessity of financial privacy."**

Cloak is not just another wallet project on Solana; it is a privacy layer designed to protect individual and institutional financial sovereignty through modern technology.

## 🚀 Core Mission and Vision

We summarize the purpose of Cloak through 4 strategic pillars:

### 1. Decoupling Identity from Transaction History 🔗
Currently, sending funds on Solana reveals the recipient's entire balance and transaction history. Cloak breaks this link. Through **Stealth Address** technology:
- Senders transmit funds not to the recipient's primary wallet, but to a unique, **one-time-use vault**.
- Until the recipient claims these funds, the destination remains anonymous on-chain.

### 2. "Graybox" Financial Isolation 📦
Cloak offers a controlled **"Graybox"** environment rather than a total "Blackbox":
- Instead of illicit anonymity that challenges regulatory frameworks, we protect the fundamental right to financial privacy.
- It enables institutional entities to manage treasuries professionally without exposing sensitive data to competitors.

### 3. Gasless and Trace-free Claim Process (Relayer Network) ⛽
The Achilles' heel of privacy protocols is the need to send gas (SOL) to a private address to withdraw funds—an action that leaves a trace. Cloak's **Relayer Network** eliminates this:
- A third-party node pays the gas fee on your behalf in exchange for a small commission.
- This ensures **zero on-chain correlation** between your main wallet and your private vaults.

### 4. Democratizing Privacy via UX (Blinks & Extension) ⚡
Privacy should not be a technical burden:
- **Blinks Integration**: Make private transfers as easy as clicking a link on X (Twitter) or Discord.
- **Modern Extension**: A 2026-standard browser extension that manages complex cryptographic operations in the background, providing a seamless user experience.
